Mini-max Tic-Tac-Toe Player
This was completed for a homework assignment. It provides a perfect 
game response using the minimax method for tic 
tac toe (or non 3x3 grid)
There are modules used that are not included here, but the code should be 
legible regardless. They will have to be created or incorportated directly 
into this file
if this minimax method is to be used
